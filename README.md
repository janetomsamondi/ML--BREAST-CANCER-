BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING SVM

CANCER is one amongst the foremost common diseases found in each men and ladies. Since the treatments are in the advanced stage, the death rate for cancer has been considerably reduced in past few years. Although advanced treatments are being found for cancer, one amongst the most challenges during this field is that the early detection of disease. There are different types of cancer supported the body part affected. Among this, breast cancer is one amongst the deadliest kinds of cancer in ladies and its the foremost common explanation for death in ladies aged between twenty and fifty nine.

With early diagnosis, many lives can be saved. This is a simple model that uses some of the clinical  physical features used to detect breast cancer. i would later propose a CNN model to improve my prediction model.
